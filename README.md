  BIGBrave Challenge

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd bigbrave-challenge/
    npm run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    The site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

3.  **Dependencies**
    
    - [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
    - [Formik](https://formik.org/)
    - [Yup](https://formik.org/)
    - [React Color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/)

4.  **Justifications**

    Formik was used for the from handling. Formik allowed a model-view controller to be implemented, which conforms the codebase to OOP principles. I had zero prior experience with Formik, and getting to grips was challenging but ultimately rewarding, as the system can be easily explanded upon due to its compartmentalised nature.


    Yup was used for field navigation, and was extremely intuitive to implement and use, thanks to numerous examples found online.


    I used React Color for a plug and play interface which allowed for an easy, out of the box colour picking interface. I did struggle for an hour or two to integrate React Color with Formik, but eventually got it working using Formik helpers, which may look like an easy solution, but it was not as clear as it seems in hindsight.


    I  used a normalized CSS file from a Formik demo, but built on and heavily altered it to style my own interface, which includes totally custom CSS only radio buttons and a stage progress section.


    I did spend about 12 hours on the project in total, which was significantly over what I initially regarded the estimated timeframe to be, but I did spend a lot of time doing research on the technology to use as well as refamiliarize myself with React, as I had not worked with it in over a year.


    The project fulfils every aspect of the original brief, and features neat techniques which accurately display my technical proficiency, but there is still room to improve many aspects of the project in order to call it a final product.
